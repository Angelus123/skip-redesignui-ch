# 🛠️ Skip Selection UI Redesign

This project is a redesign of the **"Choose your skip size"** page as part of a frontend development challenge. It focuses on a modern layout, responsiveness, and clean React + Tailwind CSS code.

---

## ✅ Challenge Goal

Redesign the page located at the “Choose your skip size” step of the booking journey, while keeping the functionality unchanged.

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully responsive skip selection layout (mobile & desktop)
- Modern design with hover effects and card UI
- Dynamic rendering of skip data (size, price, and image)
- Built using  React, Vite,TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

---

## 🧠 Why I Used Vite

Although not specified, I used [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of Create React App for the following reasons:

- Faster development and build times
- First-class support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript
- Better performance with hot module replacement
- Cleaner, minimal boilerplate with great Tailwind support
